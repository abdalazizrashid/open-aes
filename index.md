Open-AES is a new dataset published for the first time. This dataset containing
237 elements and 846 compounds collected from the Nano Technology Lab
at The National University of Science and Technology (MISIS). The main
motivation of collecting and publishing the dataset is to motivate the research
in this field. This dataset samples are collected from the PHI 680 Auger
Nanoprobe from Physical Electronics (PHI) over the years.
